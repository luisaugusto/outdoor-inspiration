Photos from the application are fetched from my galleries in [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/188326816@N04/galleries), and information about the park is pulled from the [NPS website](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm).

## Installation

Clone the repository to your computer and install dependencies.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:luisaugusto/outdoor-inspiration.git
$ cd outdoor-inspiration

$ npm install
```

## Usage

Compiles and hot-reloads for development:

```
npm run serve
```

Lints and fixes files:

```
npm run lint
```

## Building the Extensions

You can use `npm run build` to build the Vue app, and after that you will need to zip the files in the `dist` directory. Don't just compress the `dist` directory, select all the files and compress those together. Compressing the `dist` directory directly may add a level of directories, and it might not be read correctly by the browsers.

For Firefox, you can upload a build locally by navigating to [about:debugging](about:debugging), and load a temporary add-on from there. You can find more instructions [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/).

For Chrome, you can load an extension by going to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) with developer mode enabled. You can find more instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
