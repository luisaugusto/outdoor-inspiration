  "description": "Mammoth Cave National Park preserves not only the longest known cave system on earth (400+ miles), but also 53,000 acres of beautiful forest.  With nearly a dozen miles of cave trail below ground, and a surface boasting nearly 70 miles of nature trail, 13 backcountry campsites, three campgrounds, and over 20 miles of navigable river to explore and enjoy, it really is two worlds in one.
